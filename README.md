# Renaming multiple files with a text editor

This script creates a list of the files to be renamed, which can then be edited with an arbitrary text editor. When the script is run again, the files are renamed accordingly. Name collisions are detected in advance and the renaming process is not started. Swapping file names is possible. The path to a text editor can be specified inside the script, which will open the file list automatically.

### Usage

`edit-filenames.sh [FILE ...]`
